# PlazaRoute processing-algorithms

This repository contains proof-of-concept implementations of processing algorithms for pedestrian areas:

* **Visibility Graph** - based on [Integrating Open Spaces into OpenStreetMap Routing Graphs for Realistic Crossing Behaviour in Pedestrian Navigation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305272744_Integrating_Open_Spaces_into_OpenStreetMap_Routing_Graphs_for_Realistic_Crossing_Behaviour_in_Pedestrian_Navigation)
* **SpiderWeb Graph** - based on [Routing über Flächen mit SpiderWebGraph](https://gispoint.de/gisopen-paper/1613-routing-ueber-flaechen-mit-spiderwebgraph.html)

The proof-of-concepts have been written for QGIS.

Both approaches have been implemented in [plazaroute/plaza_processing](https://github.com/PlazaRoute/plazaroute/tree/master/plaza_preprocessing)
